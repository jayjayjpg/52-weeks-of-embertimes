# 52 Weeks of Ember Times

A talk based on reveal.js, a framework for easily creating beautiful presentations using HTML. [Check out the live demo](http://revealjs.com/).

### Abstract

The Ember.js Times is a weekly editorial featuring open-source contributions, blog posts, and other community projects related to the open-source project Ember.js.
By the example of the one-year old Ember.js Times we’ll take a look at the motivation behind an OSS editorial and how it can help to garner community-wide interest in current projects. We’ll see how providing regular news updates about an OSS project can shift the perception of general project activity and how it can encourage readers to give feedback or contribute to OSS initiatives themselves.
